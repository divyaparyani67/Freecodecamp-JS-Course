Q.1 We have defined a variable called yourArray. Complete the statement by assigning an array of at least 5 elements in length to the yourArray variable. Your array should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.


Ans. let yourArray = ["string", 3, true, "read" , 5]; // Change this line

Q.2 The fundamental feature of any data structure is, of course, the ability to not only store data, but to be able to retrieve that data on command. So, now that we've learned how to create an array, let's begin to think about how we can access that array's information.

When we define a simple array as seen below, there are 3 items in it:

Ans. let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Only change code below this line
myArray[1] = "d" 
// Only change code above this line
console.log(myArray);

Q.3 Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()
An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable. In this challenge, we will look at two methods with which we can programmatically modify an array: Array.push() and Array.unshift().

Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:

Ans. function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
arr.unshift('I', 2, 'three');
arr.push(7, 'VIII', 9);
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}


console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));
