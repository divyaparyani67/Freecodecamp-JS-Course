Q.1 We have defined a variable called yourArray. Complete the statement by assigning an array of at least 5 elements in length to the yourArray variable. Your array should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.


Ans. let yourArray = ["string", 3, true, "read" , 5]; // Change this line
********************

Q.2 The fundamental feature of any data structure is, of course, the ability to not only store data, but to be able to retrieve that data on command. So, now that we've learned how to create an array, let's begin to think about how we can access that array's information.

When we define a simple array as seen below, there are 3 items in it:

Ans. let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Only change code below this line
myArray[1] = "d" 
// Only change code above this line
console.log(myArray);

******************

Q.3 Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()
An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable. In this challenge, we will look at two methods with which we can programmatically modify an array: Array.push() and Array.unshift().

Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:

Ans. function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
arr.unshift('I', 2, 'three');
arr.push(7, 'VIII', 9);
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}


console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));

******************

Q.4Both push() and unshift() have corresponding methods that are nearly functional opposites: pop() and shift(). As you may have guessed by now, instead of adding, pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.

Ans.function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop(); // Change this line
  let shifted = arr.shift(); // Change this line
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));

*************************
Q.5 Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using shift() and pop(), but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.

Ans.const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];
// Only change code below this line
arr.splice(1,4)
// Only change code above this line
console.log(arr);

***************************

Q.6.Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(numbers);


Ans. function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  let setIndex = 0;
  let deleteName = 2;
arr.splice( setIndex, deleteName, "DarkSalmon", "BlanchedAlmond");
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurquoise', 'FireBrick']));

**************************

Q. 7 The next method we will cover is slice(). Rather than modifying an array, slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

Ans. function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this linelet

 

  return arr.slice(2, 4);;
}

// Only change code above this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));

**********

Q8. While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks, ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:
Ans.function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line
  newArr.push([...arr]);
    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));

********************
Q9Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:

Ans. function spreadOut() {
  let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
  let sentence = ['learning', ...fragment, 'is', 'fun']; // Change this line
  return sentence;
}

console.log(spreadOut());
************

Q10.Since arrays can be changed, or mutated, at any time, there's no guarantee about where a particular piece of data will be on a given array, or if that element even still exists. Luckily, JavaScript provides us with another built-in method, indexOf(), that allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array. indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.

For example:

Ans. function quickCheck(arr, elem) {
  // Only change code below this line
if (arr.indexOf(elem) >= 0) {
  return true;
  }
    return false;
  
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(quickCheck(['squash', 'onions', 'shallots'], 'mushrooms'));

***********************

Q.11Sometimes when working with arrays, it is very handy to be able to iterate through each item to find one or more elements that we might need, or to manipulate an array based on which data items meet a certain set of criteria. JavaScript offers several built in methods that each iterate over arrays in slightly different ways to achieve different results (such as every(), forEach(), map(), etc.), however the technique which is most flexible and offers us the greatest amount of control is a simple for loop.

Consider the following:

Ans.function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
  let newArr = [];
  // Only change code below this line
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) 
  if (arr[i].indexOf(elem) == -1) { 
newArr.push(arr[i])
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return newArr;
}

console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));
