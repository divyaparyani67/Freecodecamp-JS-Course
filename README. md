While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, I will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

Once I have the fundamentals down, I will apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

Along the way, I will also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).


In this course, I will learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. I will start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then I will learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
